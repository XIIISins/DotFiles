2016-03-19 19:57:00	ThatTreeOverTher	freeki: 1600 people, ready to take your question
2016-03-19 19:57:04	Aelius	shovel_boss: if you're having trouble with the very first step (preparing installation media), are you certain archlinux is for you?
2016-03-19 19:57:08	shovel_boss	Aelius: there is no bsd guide there :)
2016-03-19 19:57:12	Dandels	shovel_boss, you're not supposed to use the partition number for dd, but because freebsd apparently uses a different format for block devices I don't know if you wrote it to the bsd equivalent of "sda" or "sda1"
2016-03-19 19:57:16	mongy	where is this wipefs you speak of
2016-03-19 19:57:16	 < 	bghost has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2016-03-19 19:57:24	Dandels	This could very well explain that it doesn't boot
2016-03-19 19:57:41	rgb-one	shovel_boss's problem was that his device is unusable after using dd to burn an image to it. What I recommended earlier was to zero out the entire disk but all he had to do was zero out the first 512 bytes then format it

2016-03-19 19:57:54	ThatTreeOverTher	mongy: util-linux puts it in /usr/bin/wipefs
2016-03-19 19:57:57	Aelius	unless it was gpt, rgb-one 
2016-03-19 19:57:58	rgb-one	i forgot the count=1
2016-03-19 19:58:01	freeki	hey guys how to configure fonts properly? should i use standart fontconfig or get infinality?
2016-03-19 19:58:03	Cirrus_Minor	so many problems
2016-03-19 19:58:06	rgb-one	it was ntfs
2016-03-19 19:58:08	shovel_boss	is zeroing out the disk fast?
2016-03-19 19:58:12	Aelius	rgb-one.....
2016-03-19 19:58:18	Aelius	look up gpt
2016-03-19 19:58:24	ThatTreeOverTher	the fastest way to clean up an fs is wipefs, shovel_boss 
2016-03-19 19:58:27	@grawity	rgb-one: a disk can be both gpt *and* ntfs at the same time

2016-03-19 19:58:34	@grawity	rgb-one: because ntfs is a filesystem type and gpt is a partition table
2016-03-19 19:58:39	shovel_boss	im already zeroing it
2016-03-19 19:58:41	rgb-one	ah,
2016-03-19 19:58:42	@grawity	like mbr except it *doesn't* live in the first 512 bytes
2016-03-19 19:58:43	shovel_boss	and its slow
2016-03-19 19:58:47	@grawity	it lives elsewhere

2016-03-19 19:59:08	rgb-one	shovel_boss was the disk mbr or gpt?

2016-03-19 19:59:29	Dandels	shovel_boss, I suggest asking on #freebsd how to write the disk tbh.
2016-03-19 19:59:29	rgb-one	you dont have to stop it
2016-03-19 19:59:32	rgb-one	it will still work
2016-03-19 19:59:33	Dandels	Nobody here seems to have a fucking clue
2016-03-19 19:59:38	rgb-one	it will just take a longer while
2016-03-19 19:59:46	shovel_boss	Dandels: freebsd could give one less shit about me trying to get arch
2016-03-19 19:59:47	Aelius	I used freebsd a while back

2016-03-19 20:00:09	Cirrus_Minor	Batch: seems that needs only old 2.6 kernel

2016-03-19 20:00:13	shovel_boss	so ill stop the zeroing
2016-03-19 20:00:20	ThatTreeOverTher	shovel_boss: are you trying to write archlinux.iso to the drive?

2016-03-19 20:00:43	Batch	Cirrus_Minor i have no clue actually, if you can tell me
2016-03-19 20:00:47	rgb-one	ThatTreeOverTher: he already did and the disk is unresponsive
2016-03-19 20:00:50	Aelius	linfan: what is "the same way"?

2016-03-19 20:03:07	shovel_boss	usbdrive
2016-03-19 20:03:09	@grawity	it comes with its own filesystem

2016-03-19 20:15:52	lpapp	it is a shame that ratpoison went unmaintained.
2016-03-19 20:15:54	@grawity	since ... dd'ing the archiso just writes right over the same MBR anyway

2016-03-19 20:16:34	@grawity	rgb-one: but why would you do that
2016-03-19 20:16:36	rgb-one	bs stands for block size
2016-03-19 20:16:36	shovel_boss	i started zeroing then stopped it
2016-03-19 20:16:43	@grawity	rgb-one: the .iso already has its own partition table and its own "formatting"
2016-03-19 20:16:45	ThatTreeOverTher	shovel_boss: bs=1m put it in there somewhere
2016-03-19 20:16:51	lpapp	xev10: I would prefer someting like ratpoison, but maintained. It does not have to be floating for me.

2016-03-19 20:17:47	@grawity	shovel_boss: doesn't matter much, something like 4M .. 16M should be good
2016-03-19 20:17:50	@grawity	shovel_boss: it only affects speed
2016-03-19 20:17:51	Cirrus_Minor	lpapp: nice thong bout dwm is it requires no configgin, defaults r sane

2016-03-19 20:18:22	ThatTreeOverTher	lpapp: i3 has a scripting language… dwm is configurable by header file

2016-03-19 21:15:30	gregbert	the xf86-video-intel-git in the aur is 2.99.917+560+gd167280-1, but the one i get through pacman is xf86-video-intel-1:2.99.917+579+g74cd4d0-1 - should i conclude the one in the aur is old?
2016-03-19 21:15:41	UukGoblin	(arch from 2012 had the same issue; this pendrive is so slow...)
2016-03-19 21:16:10	Namarrgon	gregbert: it's a git package, the version will be updated as soon as you makepkg it

2016-03-19 21:17:01	lpapp_	i.e. not tree, but stacked windows.
2016-03-19 21:17:08	Namarrgon	gregbert: the aur interface will only show the version that was current at the time the maintainer updated it

2016-03-19 21:20:20	ItzExor	you probably don't need any additional parameters tho as long as it's working and not continuously spamming the page faults

2016-03-19 21:26:52	ItzExor	i'm guessing it has to do with how the kernel talks to the hardware with or without IOMMU though, because windows doesn't use the IOMMU at all and it USB/NIC work fine with or without it on

2016-03-19 21:46:06	TheRealBoat	hey all, I'm still having issues loading kernel modules. sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-modules-load returns failed to insert vboxguest: No such device, and Failed to insert vboxsf: No such device. Anyone have any other ideas?

2016-03-19 21:46:32	Cirrus_Minor	TheRealBoat: maybe u missing a pkg ?
2016-03-19 21:46:33	gregbert	Namarrgon: ? its just a git for compiling..
2016-03-19 21:46:36	mladoux	meh, I've built this package 3 times, no errors, but it takes a long time to compile. Anyway, I keep getting distracted so I fail to sign it and have to re-do it all over again because I didn't see a way to *just* sign the package. I'm sure I could do it with just using the gnupg2 command, but I'm lazy. First world problems, right?
2016-03-19 21:46:53	 < 	andyrtr has quit (Client Quit)

2016-03-19 21:47:28	gregbert	Namarrgon: let me look
2016-03-19 21:47:38	PlasmaPower	TheRealBoat: vboxguest should only load if arch is in a virtual machine, is that the case?
2016-03-19 21:47:39	Namarrgon	gregbert: pacman -Ql mythtv-git | ŋrep /home
2016-03-19 21:47:41	TheRealBoat	cirrus_minor, any guesses on what the pkg may be?
2016-03-19 21:47:52	TheRealBoat	I reinstalled open-vm-tools as well

2016-03-19 21:48:17	Cirrus_Minor	TheRealBoat: did u try load em manually ` modprobe vboxdrv

2016-03-19 21:48:43	d_garbage	Namarrgon, heh, what's a "ŋ" :)
2016-03-19 21:48:51	Cirrus_Minor	TheRealBoat: one of these , virtualbox-host-dkms and virtualbox-guest-dkms 
2016-03-19 21:48:55	gregbert	Namarrgon: i think that a bug. its some perl libraries.. should be installing globally and i think they got installed locally
2016-03-19 21:49:05	PlasmaPower	TheRealBoat: try modprobe vboxguest
2016-03-19 21:49:11	PlasmaPower	TheRealBoat: does that give the same error?
2016-03-19 21:49:12	TheRealBoat	cirrus_minor: why vboxdrv? its vboxguest and vboxsf that it says are missing. modprobe says no such device for the last two
2016-03-19 21:49:17	Namarrgon	gregbert: punch the maintainer
2016-03-19 21:49:23	Namarrgon	d_garbage: a typo :P
2016-03-19 21:49:35	Cirrus_Minor	TheRealBoat: was just a guide on how to load manually
2016-03-19 21:49:35	TheRealBoat	plasmapower: yeah
2016-03-19 21:49:46	gregbert	Namarrgon: unfortunately there are a ton of bugs in mythtv.. in particular the archlinux installation
2016-03-19 21:49:51	 > 	zrj has joined #archlinux
2016-03-19 21:50:00	gregbert	Namarrgon: i am not even sure how to recommend fixing some of them
2016-03-19 21:50:28	Cirrus_Minor	TheRealBoat: so prolly this pkg  virtualbox-guest-dkms 
2016-03-19 21:50:29	TheRealBoat	cirrus_minor: ok, just making sure. i have virtualbox-host and virtualbox-guest dkms 5.0.16-3
2016-03-19 21:50:32	d_garbage	:)
2016-03-19 21:51:00	Cirrus_Minor	TheRealBoat: and what happens when you try load manually ?
2016-03-19 21:51:06	PlasmaPower	TheRealBoat: are you sure that guest modules are enabled in the host?
